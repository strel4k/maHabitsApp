### MaHabitsApp

 - The MaHabitsApp app was developed as part of the learning process in the Netology course. MaHabitsApp helps you develop new habits and keep track of their progress. 
The main screen displays all the user-added habits with tracking marks.

- This project is written in Swift version 5.6.1 and is available for Xcode version 13 and later (supporting iOS minimum version 15.2). 
- The project is built using exclusively native tools. I followed the principles of OOP and SOLID while writing the code. 
- The interface is designed using UIKit based on the design project. The layout is adaptive, using AutoLayout, and displays properly on all Apple mobile phone models.
